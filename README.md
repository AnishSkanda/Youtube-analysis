The project's focus is on data analysis and TensorFlow implementation (linear regression), with a focus on statistical and exploratory analysis of patterns based on total view count and its factors, to make targeted, real-time, and educated decisions. The data of select countries such as the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and India are considered. The Python programming language, as well as TensorFlow, will be used in this project. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95709483/165540045-8ff12a38-7a27-412e-85d3-dbd18bd36b6f.png)
